The team is composed of Beto Sibileau and Gareth Hughes.

Our good practices, which we agreed in order to work fluidly, consists of the following.

1) Label our jupyter notebooks by the section so that it's easier to get a quick overview
of what that person is working on. 
2) Ensure that all functions, subsets and images are well defined and well labelled 
so that each team member can quickly analyse them without too much effort.
3) With regard to Git, to begin with, utilise seperate files to commit our work to, 
before merging into one repository once all the projects are complete and the 
work is finalised. 
4) Our jupyter notebooks will consist of data importing, data cleaning and then subsequent
data analysis with outputs of PNGs.
5) We have decided to utilise PNGs are as our image format as Google Slides does not support
SVG files and we don't require high resolution.
